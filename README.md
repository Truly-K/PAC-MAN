# PAC-MAN

## DESCRIPTION 
This program produces PacMen with the click of a button and each of them will move about the browser window at a random speed, bouncing off the walls when they reach the end of the screen.

## SKILLS 
This program demonstrates manipulating the DOM.

## HOW TO RUN
* When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman will appear at a random position on the screen.
* When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
* When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.

## ROADMAP Future improvements will include Pac-men that open and close their mouthes and will turn around to face the other direction when they hit the wall.
